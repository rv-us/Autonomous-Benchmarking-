# Picar-X Smart Agent

A simplified yet powerful agent that combines the best of both worlds: the simplicity of the basic agent with the memory and planning capabilities of the advanced agent.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Automatic Decision Making**: The agent automatically decides whether to act immediately or create a plan
- **Memory Persistence**: SQLite-based memory that persists across sessions
- **Three-Agent Architecture**: Orchestrator, Judge, and Action agents working together
- **Simplified Interface**: Clean, easy-to-understand API
- **Real-time State Tracking**: All agents have access to current servo angles and sensor readings

## 🏗️ Architecture

### 1. Orchestrator Agent
- **Purpose**: Analyzes user requests and decides the best approach
- **Decision Logic**:
  - **IMMEDIATE**: Simple commands like "Drive forward", "Turn left 20 degrees"
  - **NEEDS PLAN**: Complex tasks like "Explore the room", "Navigate around obstacles"
- **Tools**: Robot state monitoring for context-aware decisions

### 2. Judge Agent
- **Purpose**: Monitors plan progress and provides guidance
- **Capabilities**:
  - Check current plan status
  - Update progress tracking
  - Assess current robot state
  - Provide next-step guidance
- **Tools**: Planning tools + robot state + sensors (ultrasound, grayscale, camera)

### 3. Action Agent
- **Purpose**: Executes immediate commands and plan steps
- **Capabilities**: All robot control functions (movement, servos, sensors, etc.)
- **Tools**: Complete set of hardware control tools + robot state monitoring

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from picarx_agent_smart import PicarXSmartAgent

# Initialize the agent
agent = PicarXSmartAgent()

# Process a request (agent automatically decides approach)
result = agent.process_request("Drive forward at speed 30")
print(result)

# Check plan progress
progress = agent.check_plan_progress()
print(progress)

# Get current robot state
robot_state = agent.get_current_robot_state()
print(robot_state)

# Execute a specific plan step
step_result = agent.execute_plan_step("Take a picture")
print(step_result)
```

### Interactive Mode

```bash
python picarx_agent_smart.py
```

**Available Commands:**
- `quit` - Exit the program
- `reset` - Reset the robot
- `state` - Check current robot state (servos, sensors)
- `status` - Check current plan status
- `progress` - Get detailed progress report
- `execute: [step]` - Execute a specific plan step

### Example Script

```bash
python example_smart_agent.py
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. Request Processing Flow

```
User Request → Orchestrator → Decision → Action/Planning
                ↓
        IMMEDIATE or NEEDS PLAN
                ↓
        Action Agent or Judge Agent
```

### 2. Decision Examples

| Request | Decision | Action |
|---------|----------|---------|
| "Drive forward" | IMMEDIATE | Execute immediately |
| "Turn left 45°" | IMMEDIATE | Execute immediately |
| "Explore the room" | NEEDS PLAN | Create plan, use judge |
| "Find the exit" | NEEDS PLAN | Create plan, use judge |

### 3. Memory Persistence

- **Session-based**: Each agent instance maintains its own memory
- **SQLite Storage**: Persistent across program restarts
- **Context Awareness**: Agents remember previous conversations and actions

### 4. Servo Angle Tracking

- **Real-time Monitoring**: All servo angles are continuously tracked
- **Context-Aware Decisions**: Agents know current positions before making decisions
- **Smart Execution**: Commands consider current servo state for optimal execution
- **State Persistence**: Servo positions are remembered across sessions

## 📊 Plan Management

### Plan Structure
```json
{
  "task": "Explore the room and find the exit",
  "current_step": 2,
  "total_steps": 5,
  "history": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "description": "Take initial photo",
      "completed": true,
      "timestamp": 1234567890
    }
  ],
  "status": "in_progress"
}
```

### Progress Tracking
- Automatic step counting
- Timestamp tracking
- Completion status
- Action history

## 🔧 Configuration

### Session Management
```python
# Custom session ID
agent = PicarXSmartAgent(session_id="my_custom_session")

# Custom database path
agent = PicarXSmartAgent(session_id="picarx_main")
# Database will be saved as "picarx_main.db"
```

### Memory Database
- **Default**: `picarx_smart_memory.db`
- **Location**: Current working directory
- **Format**: SQLite database
- **Persistence**: Survives program restarts

## 🎮 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Movement
```
User: "Drive forward at speed 30"
Orchestrator: "IMMEDIATE: Drive forward at speed 30"
Action Agent: Executes drive_forward_tool(30)
Result: "✅ Action completed: Started driving forward at speed 30"
```

### Scenario 2: Complex Task
```
User: "Explore the room and find the exit"
Orchestrator: "NEEDS PLAN: Explore room to find exit"
Action Agent: Creates plan
Judge Agent: Provides status and guidance
Result: Plan created with next steps
```

### Scenario 3: Plan Execution
```
User: "execute: Take a picture of the current view"
Judge Agent: Updates progress
Action Agent: Executes capture_image_tool
Result: "📋 Step executed: Image captured and saved as capture.jpg"
```

### Scenario 4: Servo Angle Awareness
```
User: "Turn left 20 degrees"
Orchestrator: Checks current robot state (steering servo at -15°)
Decision: "IMMEDIATE: Turn left 20 degrees from current position"
Action Agent: Executes turn_left_tool(20) → goes to -35°
Result: "✅ Action completed: Turned left 20 degrees from -15° to -35°"
```

## 🚨 Safety Features

- **Speed Limits**: All movement functions capped at 0-100 range
- **Angle Constraints**: Servo limits prevent hardware damage
- **Emergency Stop**: `reset()` function for safe shutdown
- **Obstacle Detection**: Ultrasonic sensor integration

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Not Found**
   ```
   Error: OPENAI_API_KEY not found in keys.py
   ```
   Solution: Add your OpenAI API key to `keys.py`

2. **Memory Database Issues**
   ```
   Error: database is locked
   ```
   Solution: Ensure only one instance is running, or use different session IDs

3. **Agent Not Responding**
   ```
   Error: No response from agent
   ```
   Solution: Check internet connection and API key validity

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging by modifying the agent:
```python
# Add debug prints
print(f"Debug: Orchestrator decision: {decision}")
print(f"Debug: Action result: {result}")
```
